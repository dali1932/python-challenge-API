# python-challenge-API
The challenge deliverables consist of two files. To obtain a random city list, I utilized the Citypi library and exported it to the output folder. 
Subsequently, I utilized the OpenWeather API and Geoapify API to extract additional information based on the city list. 
In WeatherPy, I conducted an analysis to explore various relationships between different variables and obtained further insights. 
In VacationPy, I employed the Geoapify API to identify hotels in cities with ideal weather conditions and displayed these cities on a map along with their respective countries and hotel names.
