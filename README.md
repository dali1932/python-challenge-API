# python-challenge-API
There are 2 files as the challenge deliverables.
I used citypi library to get random city list and export it to the output folder.
Based on the city list, I used openWeather API and Geoapify API to gain more information.
For WeatherPy, I observed different relationships between various variables and get further anlysis results.
For VacationPy, I used Geoapify API to get the hotel in the cities with ideal weather condition and showcase the cities on the map with their countries and the hotel names.
